            <h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken: to make this recipe as simple as possible, we use chicken legs instead of cut-up whole chicken pieces. 
                    Chicken legs are easy to prep and cook up faster.</li>
                <li>Oil: use healthy olive oil for binding the seasonings to the meat and for flavor.</li>
                <li>Brown Sugar: brown sugar adds a molasses-like sweetness to balance out the spices.</li>
                <li>Thyme: plenty of thyme provides an earthy herb essence to this dish.<br> 
                    Be sure herbs are fresh, as older herbs have lost most of their flavor.</li>
                <li>Spices: a fragrant mixture of allspice, paprika, cinnamon, ginger, cloves,<br> 
                    cayenne lend incredible depth and flavor to the chicken.<br> 
                    If you can use smoked paprika, the flavors will be even more complex.</li>
                <li>Seasonings: garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper are essential for<br> 
                    the aromatics and savory aspects of this recipe.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare Ahead: The spice mixture can be prepared days ahead of time. Cinnamon, ginger, cloves, sugar,<br> 
                        thyme, cayenne, allspice, onion, garlic, and smoked paprika can all be combined in advance.</li>
                    <li>Dry and Poke: Thoroughly dry chicken pieces with clean paper towels and use a fork to poke holes 
                        throughout all the pieces.</li>
                    <li>Season: Rub all that aromatic goodness onto and under the chicken skin. That’s always my secret<br> 
                        to well-seasoned poultry: get that rub under the skin – wear gloves if you’d like, but absolutely<br> 
                        work the seasonings on top and underneath the skin throughout.</li>
                    <li>Bake: Place chicken on large rimmed/foil-lined baking sheet, with space in between each piece.<br> 
                        For smaller-sized chicken legs, bake about 40 minutes; for larger-sized chicken legs, bake about<br> 
                        50 minutes or until nicely browned.
                    </li>
