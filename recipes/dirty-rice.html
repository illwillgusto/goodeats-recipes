                <li>1/4 cup (1 1/4 ounces; 35g) finely diced celery (about 1 large rib)

                <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced
                </li>
                <li>1/2 pound (225g) ground beef</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground dried sage</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a 2-quart saucepan, rinse rice with multiple changes of cold water until the water begins to turn clear.<br> 
                        Drain rice well, return to saucepan, and cover with 2 cups (475ml) cold water along with a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>Set saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, stir rice once, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.<br> 
                        Remove from heat. Let rice stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork; set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a 10- or 12-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium heat<br>
                         until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and season with salt.<br>
                        Cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to soften and onion becomes slightly translucent, about 3 minutes.<br>
                         Stir in garlic and cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, for 1 minute longer.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground meat or sausage, season lightly with salt, then increase heat to medium-high.<br>
                         Cook, stirring and breaking up chunks of meat with a wooden spoon, until meat is fully cooked and begins to brown in spots, 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
                          Remove from heat. Scrape vegetables and meat onto a heatproof platter and set aside. </li>
                    <li>Wipe out skillet, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering.<br>
                         Add chicken giblets and season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring often, until they are fully cooked<br>
                          through and browned on all sides, about 10 minutes (you can check doneness by cutting a thicker piece of giblet in half).<br>
                           Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Wipe out the skillet once more. Return vegetable-meat mixture and processed giblets to skillet.<br>
                         Set over medium heat and stir in black pepper, ground sage, paprika, and cayenne.</li>
                    <li>Stir in rice and season with salt, if needed. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently,<br>
                         until all ingredients are incorporated and rice is fluffy and has taken on an even brown tint, about 5 minutes.<br>
                          Remove from heat and serve.</li>
